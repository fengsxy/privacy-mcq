This aligns with the notion that data was retained indefinitely until user deletion. There is no indication in the data practice of a maximum retention period, legal requirements guiding retention, or user-customizable retention periods. Therefore, option1 best reflects the practice described, where data remained publicly visible unless users took action to remove it or Google made changes following privacy complaints.",
