      "explanation": "The data practice describes a situation where Google faced significant criticism and privacy complaints due to the automatic sharing of users' email contacts in Buzz. This incident resulted in an FTC settlement that mandated Google to implement a comprehensive privacy program and undergo regular privacy audits for 20 years, indicating the establishment of a systematic approach to address privacy issues and ensure accountability. However, the data practice does not explicitly mention the creation of a dedicated privacy compliance team, nor does it specify that the system relies solely on user-reported privacy complaints to initiate corrective actions. Given the lack of specific details about these practices in the data, both options are selected to reflect potential accountability mechanisms.",
      "impact_analysis": {
        "Accountability": "The establishment of a dedicated privacy compliance team would demonstrate a proactive approach to monitoring and addressing privacy violations, enhancing accountability. Reliance on user-reported privacy complaints, on the other hand, might indicate a more reactive stance, where the system depends on users to identify issues. The FTC's requirement for a comprehensive privacy program and audits suggests a structured framework for accountability, but the absence of detailed information on internal practices leaves some uncertainty about the effectiveness of these measures."
