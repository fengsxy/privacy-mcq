These selections reflect the practice of using purchase history to generate personalized marketing materials. The other options, such as customer demographics and payment method details, were not explicitly mentioned in the data practice as being used for generating predictions.",

The practice focused on predicting pregnancy and estimating due dates to provide personalized marketing, which aligns with generating personalized coupons and recommendations. Although this method faced privacy concerns, the goal was clearly to tailor marketing efforts to individual customers based on their shopping patterns, rather than improving inventory management or sharing data with third parties.",

This aligns with option 1, which indicates that data is retained indefinitely. The incident involving the teenage girl's pregnancy suggests that Target had access to detailed purchase history over time, supporting the notion of indefinite data retention. This practice raises significant privacy concerns, as it involves extensive tracking and analysis of personal shopping behavior without explicit consent for long-term data storage.",
