There is no mention of collecting personal information such as name, address, or email (option2), browsing behavior on the retailer's website (option3), or social media interactions (option4) being used in the prediction system. Therefore, the relevant type of data collected is the purchase history, which includes items, quantities, and purchase dates (option1).

The focus was on identifying specific customer needs based on their shopping behavior to tailor marketing efforts, which aligns with the purpose of generating personalized offers.

Since the data practice does not mention any online account systems or automatic withdrawal mechanisms, options 1 and 3 are not applicable.

        "Use Limitation": "The selection of option2 indicates a lack of use limitation, as inferred data is used broadly within the marketing department and potentially across other departments without stringent controls. This raises privacy concerns as the data could be repurposed beyond its original marketing intent.",
        "Accountability": "With the selection of option2, there is an implied lack of accountability mechanisms, such as audits or policies, to ensure that inferred data is used responsibly and ethically. This could lead to privacy violations if data is misused or accessed by unauthorized parties."

Instead, they adjusted their marketing approach by mixing unrelated products with pregnancy-related advertisements to mask their targeting, without clear communication to customers about how their data was being used. This suggests reliance on implicit consent through continued service use rather than explicit communication of a comprehensive privacy policy.",

        "Openness": "The practice impacts openness negatively as there is a lack of transparent communication to customers about how their data is collected and used. By not clearly informing customers of the data practices, Target does not fulfill the openness requirement.",
        "Purpose Specification": "The absence of clear communication regarding the purpose of data collection and usage means that customers are not adequately informed about the specific purposes for which their data is being used. This impacts the Purpose Specification dimension negatively."
