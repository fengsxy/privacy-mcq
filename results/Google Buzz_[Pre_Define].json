The service automatically identified and publicly displayed the people that users frequently emailed or chatted with, without obtaining consent. This directly relates to option 4, 'Contact lists and connections'. The practice did not focus on collecting user profile information, email content, or location data as part of the social networking functionality, but rather on leveraging existing contact relationships to create social connections. Therefore, option 4 is the most relevant to the described data practice."

The ethical oversight in not obtaining user consent before making sensitive information public underscores the importance of transparent data practices."

Specifically, Buzz created a public profile that automatically connected users with their frequent email contacts, making these connections publicly visible. This meant that users' most frequent Gmail contacts were exposed as public 'followers' without adequate user consent or notification. The default public accessibility of such sensitive relationship data was a significant privacy concern, as it could unintentionally reveal private or sensitive associations to anyone on the internet, including abusive individuals or other unintended parties. Therefore, 'Publicly accessible' is the most appropriate option, reflecting the nature of the data visibility at the time of Buzz's implementation."

AES-256 encryption is a widely recognized standard for protecting data at rest and is commonly used to ensure the confidentiality and security of stored data. Given the sensitivity of information exposed by Buzz, such as email contacts, implementing a robust encryption measure like AES-256 would have been a reasonable expectation to protect user data at rest. This choice aligns with industry best practices for safeguarding user information and addresses privacy concerns effectively. Other options, such as RSA encryption, are more suited for data in transit rather than at rest, while 'Data is not encrypted at rest' would not be appropriate given the privacy implications. Additionally, 'Custom encryption solution' and 'Encryption based on regulatory requirements' may not guarantee the same level of security and standardization as AES-256."

Option 1, 'Through account settings in the app,' allows users direct control over their data, aligning with best practices for transparency and user empowerment. This method enables users to quickly and easily adjust their privacy settings or delete their data, which is essential after the issues faced with Buzz's automatic and public data exposure. Option 2, 'By contacting customer support,' provides an alternative for users who may need assistance or have complex data issues that cannot be resolved through app settings alone. This option is necessary to ensure that all users, regardless of technical ability, can manage their data effectively. While a dedicated data deletion portal (Option 3) could be useful, it is not specified in the historical context of Buzz, so the other options are more directly relevant."

In such scenarios, allowing users to request corrections is crucial. Given the nature of the issue with Buzz, where sensitive relationships were exposed, users should have the option to request corrections or changes to their data to protect their privacy. Option 2 is selected because it implies users can contact customer support to request corrections, which are then reviewed and processed manually. This approach aligns with the need for a careful review process, especially for sensitive data adjustments. Options involving automatic corrections or a dedicated portal were not selected, as they may not adequately address the need for personalized handling of sensitive cases. A manual review process by contacting customer support is more suitable for the correction of sensitive data exposure issues like those experienced in the Buzz case."

This indicates that the information was not confined to internal secure networks, nor was it restricted to third-party applications via APIs. Instead, it was publicly accessible, which implies sharing over public networks. There is no mention of encryption being used to protect this data, and the key privacy issue was the public exposure of sensitive contact relationships without user consent. Therefore, option 2 is the most appropriate, although it is noted that the data should have been encrypted to protect privacy. Option 4 is not applicable as the data was shared externally, and options 1 and 3 are not reflective of the situation described."
