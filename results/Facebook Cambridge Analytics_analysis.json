The reference to historical inadequacies and subsequent policy changes indicates that the issue was significant enough to trigger widespread criticism and necessitate reforms.

In response, Facebook changed its policies to restrict third-party access to user data and implemented stricter data sharing controls. These changes likely include options for users to control data sharing through Facebook's privacy settings, allowing them to withdraw consent for data collection and sharing by third-party applications. Therefore, option 3, which suggests that withdrawal of consent is possible through the social media platform\u2019s privacy settings, reflects the current practices implied by the changes Facebook implemented.",
