      "explanation": "The data practice for Apple's AirTag involves using a network of over a billion Apple devices to relay the AirTag's location data back to the owner. This network enables continuous real-time tracking, as AirTags can communicate with any nearby Apple devices, which then anonymously relay the location data. The tracking system's design suggests that location data can be updated very frequently, potentially every few seconds, as it relies on the proximity of other Apple devices to provide location updates. This aligns with the concept of continuous real-time tracking since the network is vast and densely populated, facilitating frequent location data relays. This approach supports the primary function of AirTags, which is to help users locate personal items efficiently and effectively.",
