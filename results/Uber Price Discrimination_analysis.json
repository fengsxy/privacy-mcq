In response to the backlash and legal consequences, Facebook implemented stricter data sharing controls. While the data practice does not specify the exact security protocols Facebook currently employs, it is reasonable to infer that Facebook would have adopted more robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access. OAuth with token expiration and IP whitelisting is a well-known approach to secure API access, which aligns with the likely improvements Facebook made to its data sharing policies post-incident. This option reflects a moderate to high level of security, which would be expected after the significant changes Facebook made in response to the data misuse scandal.",
