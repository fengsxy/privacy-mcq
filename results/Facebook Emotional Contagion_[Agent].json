      "explanation": "The data practice indicates that Facebook conducted the emotional contagion study without explicit consent from users. There is no mention of any transparency measures or detailed disclosures provided to users before the study began. This lack of transparency led to controversy over research ethics and informed consent, highlighting that users were not aware of the manipulation of their News Feed content prior to the study's execution.",
      "impact_analysis": {
        "Openness": "The lack of transparency measures before the study reflects a low level of openness in Facebook's data practices. Users were not informed about the manipulation of their emotional states, which raises concerns about the ethical implications of conducting experiments without user awareness or consent.",
        "Individual Participation": "Without transparency measures, users were unable to participate in or opt-out of the study knowingly. This impacted their ability to make informed decisions about their involvement, undermining the principle of individual participation in research where users should be aware and have control over their engagement."

        "option2"
      ],
      "explanation": "The data practice description does not mention any specific measures such as access logs or audits to ensure that the emotional content data was only used for the specified study. The focus of the description is on the lack of informed consent and ethical implications rather than on data governance or use limitation practices. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that no specific measures were mentioned as being in place to restrict data use to the study.",
      "impact_analysis": {
        "Use Limitation": "The selection of option2 implies that there were no explicit controls mentioned to ensure the data was used solely for the study, raising concerns about adherence to the principle of use limitation. Without clear restrictions, there is a risk that the data could be used for purposes beyond the original intent, which can affect user privacy.",
        "Accountability": "The absence of mentioned measures for restricting data use indicates a potential lack of accountability in the research process. Without specific controls and monitoring, it is challenging to hold parties accountable for misuse or unauthorized data access, thus impacting trust and ethical standards."

This implies that formal review processes and accountability frameworks were established post-study to address these ethical concerns and ensure better transparency in future research endeavors.",

        "Accountability": "By establishing formal review processes and accountability frameworks, Facebook aimed to ensure that future research adheres to ethical standards, thereby increasing its accountability in how user data is handled and experiments are conducted.",
        "Openness": "The implementation of new review processes suggests a move towards greater transparency in Facebook's research activities, addressing public concerns and controversies raised by the study. This openness can help build trust with users by demonstrating a commitment to ethical research practices."
