      "explanation": "During the compatibility score experiments, OKCupid collected user profile information and personality questionnaire responses to calculate and manipulate match percentages. These were essential for the experiment as the altered compatibility scores were based on these data points. Additionally, user interaction data such as message exchanges and contact information shared were collected to analyze the impact of the manipulated scores on user behavior. This is evident from the observation that users were more likely to engage in conversations when shown higher compatibility scores, even when actual compatibility was low. These data points are crucial to understanding the effect of the experiment on user interactions, which aligns with the stated goal of analyzing behavior changes due to manipulated scores. The practice raises privacy concerns regarding informed consent, as users were not aware of the manipulation of their compatibility scores during the experiment.",

The data practice describes how OKCupid altered match percentages to see how users' interactions changed when presented with different compatibility information. The focus was on understanding how the perception of compatibility influenced user behavior, such as the likelihood of engaging in conversation or exchanging contact information. This aligns with option 2, as the data collected was used to analyze behavioral responses rather than to improve accuracy (option 1), sell data to advertisers (option 3), or enhance the user interface (option 4).",
