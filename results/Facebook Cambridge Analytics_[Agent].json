      "explanation": "The data practice describes how Facebook allowed third-party developers to collect user data through apps, including the data of users who installed these apps, and importantly, the data of their Facebook friends. This implies that 'Profile information and friend list' (option1) was indeed collected since access to friends' data was a part of Facebook's friend data sharing API policy. The case with Cambridge Analytica shows that even though only a small number of users directly installed the app, the firm gained access to millions more users' data through their social connections, supporting the selection of option1. Although behavioral data (option2) can be relevant in some scenarios involving app interactions, the specific data practice does not mention this type of data collection directly and focuses on the sharing of profile and friend-related information.",

Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, obtained data from millions of users through these means and used it to create psychological profiles for political advertising. While the collection of user data could arguably enhance app functionality and features, the primary use of this data by Cambridge Analytica was to target political advertisements. This suggests that user data was effectively used in a manner akin to selling it to advertisers, as the data enabled the firm to conduct targeted political advertising campaigns. Therefore, 'To sell user data to advertisers' is the most accurate reflection of the purpose based on the described practices, especially considering the privacy implications and the resulting public and regulatory backlash.",
