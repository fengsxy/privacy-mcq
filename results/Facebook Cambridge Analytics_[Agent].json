      "explanation": "The data practice describes a scenario where Facebook allowed third-party developers to collect not only basic user data such as that typically found in a user's profile (e.g., name, email address) but also more detailed information including activity logs and friend lists. This is supported by the fact that Cambridge Analytica was able to access data from millions of users, not just those who directly interacted with the app, through Facebook's friend data sharing API. This implies that third-party apps could access comprehensive data sets that included users' friend connections and possibly their interactions, beyond just the information explicitly shared with the app by the user. The privacy implications of this practice were significant, leading to criticisms and regulatory actions against Facebook. Therefore, options 'Basic profile information such as name and email address' and 'Detailed activity logs and friend lists' are selected as they reflect the types of data collected according to the described practices.",

This aligns with option1, 'Indefinitely, until the user requests deletion,' as there was no indication in the data practice that a specific retention period or immediate deletion was enforced prior to the policy changes.
