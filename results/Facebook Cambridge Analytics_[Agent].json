Although only around 270,000 users installed the app, Cambridge Analytica was able to access data from up to 87 million users because the app had permissions to collect data not only from the users who explicitly installed it but also from their friends. This indicates that the data collection was automatic based on the permissions granted to the app, rather than through explicit user consent forms for each friend's data. Therefore, 'Automatic collection based on app permissions' is the most appropriate option reflecting the practice where app permissions allowed wide data access without direct user action for each data point collected.",

      "explanation": "The data practice description highlights that Facebook faced significant criticism and legal consequences due to inadequate controls over third-party developers, as evidenced by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. After the scandal, Facebook implemented stricter data sharing controls and changed its policies to limit third-party access to user data. This suggests a shift towards more formal mechanisms like regular audits and penalties for non-compliance to hold developers accountable. Option 1 aligns with these measures by emphasizing regular audits and penalties, which are necessary to enforce compliance and prevent data misuse.",

This approach allows for systematic oversight and creates consequences for non-compliance, thus promoting responsible data handling practices among developers."

      "explanation": "The data practice described indicates that Facebook allowed apps to collect data not only from users who installed them but also from their friends without explicit consent from those friends. This suggests an implied consent model, where users were not directly notified or required to re-consent when their data was shared with third-party applications. The widespread criticism and subsequent policy changes imply that prior to 2018, Facebook's approach was more aligned with informing users through platform updates and assuming consent unless users opted out.",
      "impact_analysis": {
        "Use Limitation": "The selection of option2 indicates a less stringent approach to use limitation, as data was shared beyond the initial user's direct consent, impacting millions of users whose data was accessed via friends who installed certain apps.",
        "Individual Participation": "Option2 reflects limited individual participation because users were not actively involved in consenting to or being notified of third-party data use changes, leading to a lack of control over how their data was shared."

      "explanation": "The data practice described in the case of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica does not mention specific mechanisms that allow users to access or correct their personal data collected by third-party applications directly through the social media platform. Instead, the historical context suggests that Facebook's previous policies allowed third-party developers to collect data in a way that did not prioritize user access or control over their data. Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that users would need to contact the third-party developers directly to address data corrections, as the responsibility for data handling and correction lies with the third parties who collected the data.",
      "impact_analysis": {
        "Individual Participation": "The option selected emphasizes the challenge users face in participating in the management of their personal data. Having to contact third-party developers directly can discourage users from taking action due to the potential complexity and lack of transparency in the process.",
        "Data Quality": "By requiring users to contact third parties directly for data correction, there is a risk of inaccuracies persisting in users' data due to potential lack of response or cooperation from third-party developers. This practice does not actively support maintaining high data quality."
