        "Purpose Specification": "The purpose of collecting IP addresses was to estimate users' proximity to competitors and adjust prices accordingly. However, without explicit communication, users are not aware of this purpose, which undermines the principle of purpose specification.",
        "Openness": "Openness requires that users are clearly informed about how their data is being used. In this case, the absence of communication about the use of IP addresses for pricing decisions means that the practice lacks transparency and openness, leading to user dissatisfaction and backlash."

      "explanation": "The data practice description does not mention any mechanism by which Staples.com informs users about the use of their geographic data for location-based pricing. The public backlash noted in the description suggests users were unaware of the pricing differences based on location, indicating a lack of transparency and communication about this practice.",
      "impact_analysis": {
        "Purpose Specification": "The purpose of using geographic data for price discrimination is not clearly communicated to users, which violates the principle of purpose specification. Users should be informed about how their data is being used to ensure they understand the implications of sharing their location data.",
        "Openness": "The lack of communication and transparency about the use of geographic data for pricing demonstrates a failure in openness. Users are not made aware of how their data affects the prices they see, leading to potential mistrust and backlash when they discover these practices through other means."
