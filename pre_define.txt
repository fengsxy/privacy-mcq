Here is a logics to about privacy askinator
every key is pointed to a question,
 for the question we need to ask  a lof of question to navigate a data practice, you can based on user provided context and the control flow I give you to generate question.

Now let's start, you can ask me question one by one. 
You should follow the logic map I send u, fisrt 5 question determin the data flow, then ask detialed question, then ask some stakeholder interaction question.
After 10 questions, you can generate the data. For the qeustion please generate possible low level choice.
